### Date: 22nd September 2017

#### Who did you help this week?


#### Who helped you this week?

* I had a chat with Smriti about next changes on data crawler.
* Met with Mathias about bugs on Openmind queue. We tried out few things to understand the process.
* Olga added to the Gablab mailing list.

#### What did you achieve?

* Fixed the bug for uploading files from Openmind to Dropbox and uploaded data.
* Worked on OSG and exchanged emails with Satra about the issue. 
* I had meetings with Smriti and Mathias.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Openmind scheduler is buggy. Could not run my tasks.
* OSG still giving errors. I think external variables doesn't get set properly in singularity container on OSG as the way to run container is not usual. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Mathias shared his scripts to run jobs on Openmind which are working for the same config I am trying. I am going to use those scripts to see if there are any changes.
* Work on data crawler with freesurfer validator.

#### Any other topics

### Date: 15th September 2017

#### What did you struggle with?

* OSG
   - ANTS and Freesurfer are working on the OSG but mingboggle itself is still not working.
   - I think there is python versioning problem (not sure though). 
   - Last week Dorota helped me read crash files. I will look into error more next week.
* T1 data list
   - I realized that there is a lot of repetition of files in openneuro list. The actual number of files could be a few thousands. 
* Openmind
   - I am running some jobs on Openmind until OSG problem is resolved.
   - But unable to upload data from Openmind to Dropbox. It is giving timeout error.
   - Presently working on fixing it, so that I could transfer the data generated to dropbox.
* Datacrawler
   - Working with Smriti. I am specifically focusing on validating directory structure (e.g. freesurfer).

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Figure out errors getting on OSG
* Transfer data to Dropbox from Openmind.
* Work with Smriti on datacrawler and related stuff.

#### Any other topics

I am reading some research articles for potential research proposals and want to discuss when we meet in person.
