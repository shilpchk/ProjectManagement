# Weekly Meetings

---


### Date: 15th September 2017

#### What did you struggle with?

* OSG
   - ANTS and Freesurfer are working on the OSG but mingboggle itself is still not working.
   - I think there is python versioning problem (not sure though). 
   - Last week Dorota helped me read crash files. I will look into error more next week.
* T1 data list
   - I realized that there is a lot of repetition of files in openneuro list. The actual number of files could be a few thousands. 
* Openmind
   - I am running some jobs on Openmind until OSG problem is resolved.
   - But unable to upload data from Openmind to Dropbox. It is giving timeout error.
   - Presently working on fixing it, so that I could transfer the data generated to dropbox.
* Datacrawler
   - Working with Smriti. I am specifically focusing on validating directory structure (e.g. freesurfer).

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Figure out errors getting on OSG
* Transfer data to Dropbox from Openmind.
* Work with Smriti on datacrawler and related stuff.

#### Any other topics

I am reading some research articles for potential research proposals and want to discuss when we meet in person.
