## Working open

At the group we are dedicated to working as openly as possible. We believe that our endeavors will be more successful through clear communication and collaboration than by keeping secrets. This repository is designed to showcase our "work in progress". You're welcome to help out along the way!

We may have private repositories if our collaborators are more comfortable with restricted working on some projects, but we aspire to "be the change" and demonstrate open working practices wherever possible.
